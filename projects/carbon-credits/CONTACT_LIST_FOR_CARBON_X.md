Taylor,

Below is a list of potential carbon credit buyers I'd like to reach out to on behalf of Walker Ranch Holdings. These are strategic targets connected to the **Stargate data center project** in Texas (~90 miles from Walker Ranch), plus related companies with strong net-zero commitments.

**Before I reach out, can you confirm Carbon X hasn't already contacted any of these?**

## Questions for Carbon X

1. Have you contacted any of these companies already?
2. Any you'd prefer to handle directly vs. having me reach out?
3. Can you provide contacts for the "TBD" entries?
4. Any other Stargate-connected targets I should add?
5. Do you have relationships with any of these that I should know about?

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly.
