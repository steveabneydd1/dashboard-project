# Stargate Project - Carbon Credit Buyer Targets

## The Strategic Angle

**Stargate** is a $500B AI data center project starting in Texas (Abilene area). It will create a massive carbon footprint from:
- Data center energy consumption
- Construction emissions
- Supply chain emissions

**Your Walker Ranch project** is ~90 miles from the Stargate site. You can offer:
1. **Local offsets** for their Texas operations
2. **Ongoing partnership** — more legacy wells in the region to plug
3. **Story alignment** — offsetting AI's climate impact with Texas methane abatement

## Microsoft - Deep Dive (Top Target)

**Why Microsoft is the #1 target:**
- **Carbon negative by 2030** — most aggressive goal of any Stargate partner
- **$1B Climate Innovation Fund** for carbon reduction/removal tech
- **Internal carbon fee** — they charge business units for emissions
- **Procurement requirements** — carbon reduction is part of supplier evaluation
- **Massive buyer** — actively purchasing high-quality carbon credits at scale
- **Azure connection** — OpenAI runs on Azure, Microsoft expanding Azure for Stargate

**Key People to Target:**
- **Melanie Nakagawa** — Chief Sustainability Officer
- **Lucas Joppa** — Chief Environmental Officer (if still there)
- **Sustainability Procurement Team** — handles carbon credit purchases

**Pitch Angle:**
> "You're building Stargate in Texas. We're permanently plugging methane-leaking wells 90 miles away. We have 330,000 verified credits ready now, and a pipeline of similar projects in the region. Let's discuss a strategic partnership to offset Stargate's footprint with local, high-integrity methane abatement."
