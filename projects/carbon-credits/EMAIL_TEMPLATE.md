**Subject:** Walker Ranch Methane Project — Quick Intro?

---

[Name],

I'm reaching out as an agent of Walker Ranch Holdings. We recently partnered with Carbon X Credits to permanently plug 23 legacy oil and gas wells on our ranch, the Walker Ranch, in Stephens County, Texas — about 90 miles from where [Company] is building out infrastructure for the Stargate project.

The wells were leaking methane and wouldn't have been plugged without carbon finance. The project generated over 300,000 verified carbon credits through the BCarbon registry, and the 5,000-acre ranch is now undergoing prairie restoration with Texas Parks & Wildlife.

You can see the full project overview here: [carbonxcredits.com/projects/walker-ranch](https://www.carbonxcredits.com/projects/walker-ranch)

I'd love to share the story of what we accomplished and explore whether there's a fit with [Company]'s sustainability goals. I can speak to the project at a high level, and for any technical or diligence questions, I'd be happy to connect you directly with the Carbon X team.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?

Best,
Steve Abney

## Key Points in This Version

✅ **Sets expectations:**
- "I can speak to the project at a high level"
- "For technical or diligence questions, I'd connect you with Carbon X"

✅ **Story-focused, not technical:**
- Doesn't mention GWP20, ISO standards, or methodology details
- Focuses on the narrative (wells leaking, prairie restoration, Texas location)

✅ **No pricing mentioned** — that comes later with Carbon X involved

✅ **Clear ask** — 15 minutes for a call

## Attachment Strategy

**Option A: No attachment (recommended for first email)**
- Keeps it simple and low-commitment
- Less likely to get caught in spam filters
- You can send details after they express interest

**Option B: One-page PDF summary**
- Only if they ask for more info before a call
- Keep it visual / story-focused, not technical

**My recommendation:** No attachment on first email. If they reply asking for more info, then send a one-pager or offer to connect them with Carbon X.
