<h2>Email Template — General Version</h2>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Walker Ranch Methane Project — Quick Intro?</p>
<hr />
<p>[Name],</p>
<p>I'm reaching out as an agent of Walker Ranch Holdings. We recently partnered with Carbon X Credits to permanently plug 23 legacy oil and gas wells on our ranch, the Walker Ranch, in Stephens County, Texas — about 90 miles from where [Company] is building out infrastructure for the Stargate project.</p>
<p>The wells were leaking methane and wouldn't have been plugged without carbon finance. The project generated over 300,000 verified carbon credits through the BCarbon registry, and the 5,000-acre ranch is now undergoing prairie restoration with Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife.</p>
<p>You can see the full project overview here: <a href="https://www.carbonxcredits.com/projects/walker-ranch">carbonxcredits.com/projects/walker-ranch</a></p>
<p>I'd love to share the story of what we accomplished and explore whether there's a fit with [Company]'s sustainability goals. I can speak to the project at a high level, and for any technical or diligence questions, I'd be happy to connect you directly with the Carbon X team.</p>
<p>Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?</p>
<p>Best,
Steve Abney<br />
Agent, Walker Ranch Holdings, LLC<br />

<h2>Key Points in This Version</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Sets expectations:</strong>
- "I can speak to the project at a high level"
- "For technical or diligence questions, I'd connect you with Carbon X"</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Story-focused, not technical:</strong>
- Doesn't mention GWP20, ISO standards, or methodology details
- Focuses on the narrative (wells leaking, prairie restoration, Texas location)</p>
<p>✅ <strong>No pricing mentioned</strong> — that comes later with Carbon X involved</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Clear ask</strong> — 15 minutes for a call</p>
<hr />
<h2>Attachment Strategy</h2>
<p><strong>Option A: No attachment (recommended for first email)</strong>
- Keeps it simple and low-commitment
- Less likely to get caught in spam filters
- You can send details after they express interest</p>
<p><strong>Option B: One-page PDF summary</strong>
- Only if they ask for more info before a call
- Keep it visual / story-focused, not technical</p>
<p><strong>My recommendation:</strong> No attachment on first email. If they reply asking for more info, then send a one-pager or offer to connect them with Carbon X.</p>
